- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mightydealers - this is an angram for my real name! See if you can figure it out :D
- 👀 I’m interested in lots of things; I'm a student so I like games, small bits of code, ways to make work easier or fun, like bookmarklets!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, but mostly I do research and compile websites and bits of code with fun things on them
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything right now - I'm busy as a student. 
- 📫 How to reach me - Use Github to message, if you can't use it then I probably don't need to be bothered lol!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/He/He - I'm a comedian.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have some big feet. They are size 17 mens!
